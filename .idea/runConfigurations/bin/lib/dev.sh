    #       while using Git
    # @note It is mounted the SSH agent socket (`$SSH_AUTH_SOCK`)
    #       to the container. In that way, we can use it to
    #       execute SSH connections to our trusted hosts
    #       without sharing our private keys.
    #       This is useful to work with SSH repositories
